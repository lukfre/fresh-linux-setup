# setup-linux
Bash script containing my usual setup for fresh linux installation.

Open a terminal **in the repo folder**, launch the script and you're good to go.
```
$ cd /path/to/working_dir
$ git clone git@github.com:lukfre/setup-linux.git 
$ cd ./setup-linux
$ ./setup_linux.sh
```

The script will ask you to install stuff such as:
- git
- curl
- gparted
- vscode (you may need to install it by yourself using `--classic`)
- telegram
- shotwell
- gnome-weather
- gnome-browser-connector
- GNOME Extensions
- miniconda
- Spotify (and Spot-X)
- Obsidian
- Zotero

It will also ask you to setup the integration git-vscode (i.e., it drives you to creating a new SSH key etc.)

Feel free to modify to better suit your needs `:]`
